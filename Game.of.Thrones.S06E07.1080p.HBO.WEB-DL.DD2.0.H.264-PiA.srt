1
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,209
He's the reason why

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,250
Company.

3
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:11,709
Hundreds will die.

4
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,959
and we have to fight together.

5
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,459
Let's go. C'mon C'mon.

6
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:52,959
even to the gods.

7
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:56,998
Gentlemen, please.

8
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:57,999
To my right.

9
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,751
You too, come on.

10
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:02,792
C'mon C'mon.

11
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,376
take Winterfell, my lady.

12
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:50,918
Ramsay Bolton cannot

13
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,709
How many men were

14
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,250
necessary to face it?

15
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,751
from Bear Island...

16
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,584
The shame was so heavy

17
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,999
It was a woman.

18
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,167
I think some people

19
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,375
they are afraid of you.

20
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,542
I'm used to it.

21
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,376
we are cowards.

22
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,959
who had been dead for days.

23
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,980
It was smelly,

24
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,459
with animals everywhere...

25
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,209
and bones coming out of here.

26
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,271
You are an anointed knight.

27
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,375
that the war is not between

28
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,999
I almost died of fright.

29
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,146
No need to ask

30
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,292
I put it in the cart, but it didn't happen.

31
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,313
I thought I would die

32
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,167
on other days, but no.

33
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,501
What made him live?

34
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,417
But you must go, grandma.

35
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,626
- Lord Edmure.

36
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,998
It's still here for a reason.

37
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,375
Yes there is. I'm hard to kill.

38
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,417
We will go to Meereen.

39
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,542
The gods still

40
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:38,543
They want you here.

41
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,667
I've heard this before.

42
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,647
- as a wife.

43
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,751
of another god.

44
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:47,168
Our two old houses

45
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,709
I don't know much about the gods.

46
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,792
You are not in the right career.

47
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,521
There are many godly motherfuckers

48
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,042
Who do they think they know...

49
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,998
the word of god or gods.

50
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,167
It's not me. I don't even know the name

51
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:58,334
truth about them.

52
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,209
Maybe it's the Seven.

53
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,501
most experienced in Westeros.

54
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,792
It's your brother?

55
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:05,959
Or maybe everything is

56
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,083
the same thing.

57
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,626
I don't know.

58
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,709
What matters, I believe...

59
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,814
I think I have beer

60
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:13,876
As long as you are alive,

61
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:15,918
And whatever it is...

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,626
will involve Sandor Clegane.

63
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,999
I didn't know myself before.

64
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,999
You don't know the things I've done.

65
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,125
Stannis as much as the Boltons.

66
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,501
If gods exist...

67
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,876
hundreds of generations.

68
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,834
that the war is not between

69
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,501
Majesty.

70
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,000
What are we going to read today?

71
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,000
- The Mother's Book,
- His Holiness.

72
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,042
Capítulo 3, verso 12.

73
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,313
“The water passes through the stones,

74
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:13,792
leveling..."

75
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,917
But you must go, grandma.

76
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:15,998
He's the reason why

77
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,875
Company.

78
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:19,751
the brute nature of a man.

79
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,541
The wife relieves the injuries

80
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,998
your husband...

81
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,999
the mother sings

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
for your child to sleep."

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,167
You learn fast.

84
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,105
See you soon, dear.

85
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,667
every verse of the holy book...

86
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,938
House Stark for centuries.

87
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,167
of mercy from the Mother...

88
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,105
and wild

89
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,542
who doesn't know how to read...

90
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:39,999
to understand

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the wisdom of the Father.

92
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,042
For years, I...

93
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,667
I pretended to love the poor,

94
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,000
the afflicted.

95
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,999
I felt sorry for them, but...

96
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,209
I never loved them.

97
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,959
They disgusted me.

98
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,999
They are hard to love.

99
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,541
The poor make us sick

100
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,999
Because we are...

101
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:03,999
without our illusions.

102
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,646
They show us what we would be like

103
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,250
without our fine clothes.

104
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,376
What would we smell like?

105
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:10,459
without perfume.

106
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,501
I can do

107
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:15,502
an intimate question?

108
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,959
He is fine.

109
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,499
The king mentioned that,

110
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,999
We must defend them.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,334
of the Immaculate.

112
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:26,667
in your wedding bed.

113
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:28,999
No.

114
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,083
I am your killer.

115
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,543
you are women and children.

116
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:34,918
After they're done with me,

117
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,083
even to the gods.

118
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,999
Let's go. C'mon C'mon.

119
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,334
But we were not animals.

120
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,042
I don't have them anymore.

121
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,709
Congress requires no desire

122
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,375
by the woman...

123
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,417
We have Lord Edmure.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,999
and we need to defeat them

125
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,064
if we want to continue

126
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:58,209
while your mother screamed

127
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,501
and my friends held her.

128
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,667
Sometimes it's hard to find

129
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,042
the right way.

130
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,541
Hard to find and more

131
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,083
difficult to navigate.

132
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,209
But it has already made a lot of progress.

133
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,125
I pray your grandmother follows you.

134
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,334
My grandmother?

135
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:22,918
Yes.

136
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,147
The Queen of Thorns

137
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,334
burned like Mance.

138
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,542
a strong woman...

139
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,000
and an unrepentant sinner.

140
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,793
I should teach you

141
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:31,959
the new path...

142
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,918
as she taught him the old man.

143
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,334
- Or I fear
- for her safety...

144
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,000
Body and soul.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,542
Does she move or talk?

146
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,459
I want to talk to you alone.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,542
Septa Unella is my true one

148
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,083
friend and advisor.

149
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,959
This is crazy!

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Not in your sanctuary

151
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,998
He's the reason why

152
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,209
Company.

153
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,625
Hundreds will die.

154
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,998
they will come after you.

155
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,250
Drink it.
- Until you ask them to stop.

156
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,667
If I ask them to stop.

157
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,375
You don't want my ring.

158
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,999
Grandma, stop.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,292
what did they do to you?

160
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,751
You marched against

161
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,167
the High Sparrow, against the Faith.

162
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,459
We march for you.

163
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,418
that we have.

164
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,334
but they showed mercy.

165
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,667
It's your brother?

166
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,959
What mercy did they show him?

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,021
Loras' only hope

168
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,042
is to confess and repent.

169
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,896
If you do this, faith will allow

170
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,709
-I've heard enough.

171
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:36,855
He will have to resign

172
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:37,959
They thought I was brave.

173
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,959
stand out in memory.

174
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:40,626
I didn't know myself before.

175
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,333
He is the heir of the Garden

176
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,998
from Above, the future House Tyrell.

177
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,541
-He can start again.

178
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,083
-Like a stupid fanatic.

179
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,709
without perfume.

180
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,584
- Will leave for
- Now I would like

181
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,104
I fought them in Durolar.

182
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:55,209
this should stay here.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,292
I'm the queen.

184
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,499
It is my duty to serve

185
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,999
my husband, the king.

186
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,999
But you must go, grandma.

187
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,999
Your place is at home.

188
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,083
I will never leave her.

189
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:14,292
- -Never.
- -You must.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,626
Go home.

191
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,604
Find comfort

192
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:22,999
Yes, you.

193
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,999
You learn fast.

194
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,459
See you soon, dear.

195
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,250
House Stark for centuries.

196
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,209
She was a great warrior.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We said we would fight

198
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:17,999
like you...

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,125
when the time came,

200
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,250
and we were serious...

201
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,292
but that was not what was agreed.

202
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:25,147
He was the commander

203
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,959
You lost, Cersei.

204
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,376
Chose this place

205
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:31,626
no one would be here.

206
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,980
You would all be meat

207
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,501
in the Night King's army.

208
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,980
Regicide.

209
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,417
burned like Mance.

210
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,355
Remember the camp

211
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,083
from Mance? I went to the horizon.

212
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,334
And look at us now.

213
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,209
You are a Westerosi.

214
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,626
If we lose this...

215
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,125
Lost.

216
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:52,999
If gods exist...

217
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,167
hundreds of generations.

218
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,584
As if we never existed.

219
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,021
We will be the last

220
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,042
of the Free People.

221
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,355
This is what will happen

222
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,626
with you if we lose.

223
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,750
The Boltons, the Karstarks,

224
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:08,999
the Umbers...

225
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:10,959
And we will leave at dawn.

226
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,813
He's the reason why

227
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,459
Welcome to Bear Island.

228
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:15,792
Hundreds will die.

229
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,083
they will come after you.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,334
Drink it.

231
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,854
- Until you ask them to stop.

232
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,709
I don't have them anymore.

233
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,375
Congress requires no desire

234
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,229
We need more men.

235
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,459
We have Lord Edmure.

236
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,022
and we need to defeat them

237
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,542
We are not a big house,

238
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,209
On my honor.

239
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,001
because he said

240
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:43,083
by the Free People...

241
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,167
when none

242
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,209
Hard to find and more

243
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:46,999
for a war

244
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,876
- -Hang on.

245
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,250
you will see an army at the gates,

246
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,584
we are cowards.

247
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,000
And if that's what we are...

248
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,104
we deserve to be

249
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,209
the last Free Peoples.

250
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,292
Snow.

251
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you sure they will come?

252
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,625
We are not that smart

253
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:05,998
like you southerners.

254
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,999
When we say

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,999
we will do something...

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Right, Mr. Davos

257
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,667
on other days, but no.

258
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:28,999
albeit from King's Landing.

259
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,918
see who I deal with.

260
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,876
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

261
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,021
It's still here for a reason.

262
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,042
rotting in a cell?

263
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,521
Now, let's say I threaten

264
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:39,959
in a cell because of you.

265
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,917
However, the man spoke

266
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,584
this city because of you.

267
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,230
Our two old houses

268
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,834
of another god.

269
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,293
because of you

270
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,709
and your stupidity.

271
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,542
You are sure.

272
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,168
I made a horrible mistake.

273
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,709
I carry it with me every day.

274
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,334
Great.

275
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,729
Brought an army

276
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,083
of fanatics at our door.

277
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,459
And now we must fight

278
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,667
What mercy did they show him?

279
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,292
We need each other.

280
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,376
- We sent ravens

281
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,792
person I've ever met.

282
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,438
Make your men

283
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,542
It's hard to remember.

284
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,251
But the most perverse

285
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:22,167
stand out in memory.

286
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,042
- To remember
These are our towers...

287
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,001
When my grandchildren were

288
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,918
dragged to their cells?

289
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,959
And make no mistake, my lady...

290
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,501
If gods exist...

291
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,417
But we still have a chance...

292
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:35,959
I love my son.

293
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,999
in the Fist of the First Men.

294
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,334
We must defend them.

295
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,209
I'm leaving this town as soon as possible

296
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,709
as soon as possible before...

297
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,626
that that fanatic without shoes

298
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,501
throw me in one of your cells.

299
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,938
If you're as smart as you say you are,

300
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,751
will escape from here too.

301
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,792
He's the reason why

302
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,834
Company.

303
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,417
-Lord Glover, if you hear us.

304
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,563
Not supported.

305
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:01,792
No more.

306
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,479
Your brother is gone.

307
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,999
for your child to sleep."

308
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:06,771
The rest of your

309
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:07,999
We fight with the army

310
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,751
People despise her.

311
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,459
You are surrounded by enemies,

312
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,709
thousands of them.

313
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,417
Are you going to kill them alone?

314
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,459
to understand

315
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,729
It's the only joy I find

316
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,083
in this sadness.

317
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,626
These are not walkers

318
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:32,999
If it weren't for him,

319
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,709
Continuous!

320
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,459
It's a bad siege attempt.

321
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,417
Someone needs to teach them

322
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:20,999
to fulfill the oath

323
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,167
Need yes.

324
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:25,584
No.

325
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:28,584
It's not me. I'm just a mercenary.

326
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,209
You are an anointed knight.

327
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,626
There is a big difference.

328
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,709
Yes, passengers are not paid.

329
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,543
on other days, but no.

330
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,334
than a Lannister officer.

331
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,542
- It's like saying
- that I have a bigger penis...

332
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:40,709
That someone in the army

333
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,834
of the Immaculate.

334
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,272
I hope to command them all

335
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,792
It's still here for a reason.

336
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,751
You can be

337
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,876
I lost my right hand.

338
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,876
You promised me title

339
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:55,250
I am your killer.

340
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,209
After they're done with me,
- as a wife.

341
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,459
And it will have all three things.

342
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,896
-A Lannister always...

343
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,000
-Do not say that.

344
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,667
Do not say that.

345
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,043
Come out and fight us,

346
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,334
Black fish.

347
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:26,792
We have Lord Edmure.

348
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,147
Surrender the castle

349
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:31,501
- some bad years.

350
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,375
when the men of iron

351
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,999
Hand over the castle.

352
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,334
You think I won't do it,

353
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,417
You are old?

354
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,084
I slit your throat

355
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,667
it's not safe.

356
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:16,709
And where was it?

357
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,959
Running and hiding

358
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,167
like a coward.

359
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,792
Hand over the castle...

360
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,417
or I'll slit his throat.

361
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,708
Continue, then.

362
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,999
Cut your throat.

363
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:00,999
Lothar, right?

364
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:03,918
Mr Jaime.

365
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,501
We didn't know this was coming.

366
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,647
Why didn't you score?

367
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:08,751
a straight perimeter.

368
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,542
Permitiu que 8.000 homens

369
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,292
whose name is Stark.

370
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,938
I'm glad we're friends

371
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,542
otherwise they would be screwed now.

372
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,542
- Bathing and feeding
- Lord Edmure.

373
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,501
Walder.

374
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,605
Edmure is a prisoner

375
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,000
of House Frey.

376
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,147
He's the reason why

377
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:31,667
and does not put them into practice.

378
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,479
and served Stannis for years.

379
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,959
beat you...

380
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,479
unless you shut up,

381
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,959
but he kept talking.

382
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:38,999
What are you doing here?

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm not bothered...

384
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,834
- Now you want

385
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,334
to get this castle back.

386
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:46,999
Could be skinned

387
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:48,959
Unless you want

388
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,999
take your place.

389
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,688
Sorry, Mr. Jaime.

390
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,083
Do what he says.

391
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,751
We don't have horses.
- under my command.

392
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,542
When the black fish appears

393
00:21:58,543 --> 00:21:59,834
those walls...

394
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:01,438
you will see an army at the gates,

395
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,998
That's not what's there.

396
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:03,999
Make your men

397
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,999
dig trenches.

398
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,834
that the war is not between
- a cada 100 jardas.

399
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,022
I didn't know myself before.

400
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,167
in towers and trebuchets.

401
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:10,709
These are our towers...

402
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,230
As I said, the siege

403
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,709
is under my command.

404
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,188
that the war is not between

405
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:16,292
-They follow the Red God.

406
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,918
an intimate question?

407
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:26,083
I want a negotiation.

408
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,959
Negotiation or fight?

409
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,042
We must defend them.

410
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:32,876
You have one hand.

411
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,959
But you must go, grandma.

412
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,999
Kill them?

413
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,542
Welcome to Bear Island.

414
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,834
I will never leave my son.
- -Never.

415
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,021
You have the same name

416
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,042
What an Aunt Lyanna.

417
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,334
I don't want to fight anymore.

418
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,542
You will be too.

419
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:14,542
No more.

420
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:16,126
My mother was not beautiful nor did she have

421
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:17,667
any other kind of beauty.

422
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,542
She was a great warrior.

423
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:20,792
She died fighting

424
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,999
by his brother, Robb.

425
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,396
I served your uncle at the Castle

426
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,999
Black, Lady Lyanna.

427
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,604
He was also a great

428
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:32,125
warrior and a man of honor.

429
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,959
- I was your butler.
- I...

430
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,250
We've already said too much.

431
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:36,876
Why are you here?

432
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,980
Stannis Baratheon

433
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,167
I will hear her screaming

434
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,543
before marching

435
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:44,876
to Winterfell and be killed.

436
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,501
I saw the letter you wrote

437
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:48,042
when he asked for men. He said ...

438
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,709
I do not want anything.

439
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,334
That Bear Island only has...

440
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,667
our subordinates?

441
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:53,959
whose name is Stark.

442
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,354
Robb died,

443
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,999
but House Stark does not.

444
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,896
- I'm not going to make jokes

445
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,000
more than ever.

446
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,396
I came with my sister to ask

447
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:06,999
the alliance of House Mormont.

448
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,500
I understand that you are a snow

449
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,000
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

450
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,334
Or is she a Lannister?

451
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,792
I am your killer.

452
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:28,604
I did what I had to do

453
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:29,999
Hundreds will die.

454
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,667
they will come after you.

455
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:32,999
Drink it.

456
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,125
-Do not say that.

457
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:35,980
Anyway,

458
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,209
You don't want my ring.

459
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,834
- and we will kill

460
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,438
Ramsay Bolton cannot

461
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,999
take Winterfell, my lady.

462
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,334
It is our duty to stop it.

463
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:44,959
Even more so now that he

464
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,250
our brother Rickon...

465
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,000
by the Free People...

466
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,250
What you have to understand is that...

467
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,105
I'm responsible for Ilha dos

468
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,918
Bears and everyone who lives in it.

469
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,604
If we don't want to do

470
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,999
I pray your grandmother follows you.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
for a war

472
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,001
Isn't that mine?

473
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:07,999
Please, my lady...

474
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:11,083
I understand how you feel.

475
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,834
I do not know him.

476
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,000
Sir...?

477
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:15,063
Davos, my lady,

478
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:16,083
of Seaworth House.

479
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,730
is to bring kindness to this world.

480
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,792
About my house. It's quite new.

481
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:23,999
Right, Mr. Davos

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
on other days, but no.

483
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,250
- How do you understand
- how I feel?

484
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,272
Never thought you'd find yourself

485
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:31,626
in this position.

486
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,667
and slit your wrists.

487
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:35,083
We will go to Meereen.

488
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:36,938
in a cell because of you.

489
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:37,999
who would be in this position.

490
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,500
I was the son of a fisherman,

491
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,000
So I was a drug dealer.

492
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,604
Now I talk to a lady

493
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:44,998
You are not in the right career.

494
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:46,667
in time of war.

495
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,501
are on the verge of collapse...

496
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:50,292
When my brother

497
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:52,999
It's our war.

498
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:56,709
You are sure.

499
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,167
- Your uncle,
- Lord Commander Mormont...

500
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,250
Maybe it's the Seven.
- your butler.

501
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,168
He chose Jon to be

502
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:06,626
his successor because he knew...

503
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,896
AND?

504
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:09,125
do what was right...

505
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,459
even if it meant

506
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,751
of your life.

507
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,646
Because Jeor Mormont

508
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,292
It's not what we expected.

509
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,147
that the war is not between

510
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:18,959
but House Stark is dead.

511
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,999
It is between the living and the dead.

512
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,292
And make no mistake, my lady...

513
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,999
the dead are coming.

514
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:31,751
And truth?

515
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,521
“The water passes through the stones,

516
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:37,042
in the Fist of the First Men.

517
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,250
I fought them in Durolar.

518
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,626
We both lost.

519
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,104
While the Boltons

520
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,209
There's Winterfell...

521
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,999
the North will be divided.

522
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,646
And a divided North will not have

523
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,292
chance against the Night King.

524
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,583
You want to protect your people.

525
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:53,999
He's the reason why

526
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,918
But there is no hiding.

527
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:57,709
the brute nature of a man.

528
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,999
and we have to fight together.

529
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,980
It is not enough.

530
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,876
com a Casa Stark há 1.000 anos.

531
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,999
We will not stop being loyal.

532
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:26,999
Thank you my lady.

533
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,000
- How many men
- We can wait?

534
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,209
You?

535
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:42,999
Sixty two?

536
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,500
We are not a big house,

537
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:45,998
We march for you.

538
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,999
And every man

539
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,999
from Bear Island...

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,313
Fight hard

541
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:50,626
of ten men from dry land.

542
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,562
If they have half

543
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:53,999
warrior and a man of honor.

544
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,918
the Boltons will be finished.

545
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,083
Regicide.

546
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:16,626
Black fish.

547
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,834
I think it's here...

548
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,043
to fulfill the oath

549
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,626
that my niece made.

550
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,834
without our illusions.

551
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,334
They are not with me.

552
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:27,459
Some of us still like it.

553
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,709
Do you want to go back to captivity?

554
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:33,584
And why are you here?

555
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,042
You know why I'm here.

556
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,397
This castle belongs

557
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,042
to Casa Frey. You invaded.

558
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,542
In the name of King Tommen,

559
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:41,999
I order you to surrender or...

560
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,667
Or will he kill Edmure?

561
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,917
I am your killer.

562
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,167
even death.

563
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,022
I am your killer.

564
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:51,834
Company.

565
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:52,918
You promised me title

566
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,959
storming the castle.

567
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,000
After they're done with me,

568
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:56,999
Hundreds of mine.

569
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:58,792
With me. I shouldn't ask them.

570
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,125
- If you can cross
Gentlemen, please.

571
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,584
Congress requires no desire

572
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,751
I need you with me
- some bad years.

573
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,959
and we need to defeat them

574
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,083
if we want to continue

575
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,125
On my honor.

576
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:14,751
Your Honor?

577
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,105
Hard to find and more

578
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,751
it's not safe.

579
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,209
The war is over, sir.

580
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,251
Running and hiding

581
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:23,834
for a lost cause?

582
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:30,730
As long as you are alive,

583
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:32,709
It was smelly,

584
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,459
This is my house.

585
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,751
I'll keep a bowl

586
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,292
ready to die in it.

587
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,000
you coughed.

588
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,876
or starve us to death.

589
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:47,667
We have provisions

590
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,000
enough for two years.

591
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:53,792
Right, Mr. Davos

592
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,292
You clearly don't have any

593
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,000
But we still have a chance...

594
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:04,667
Why did you come to me?

595
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:06,876
Sieges are boring.

596
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,459
with you if we lose.

597
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,834
see who I deal with.

598
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,751
Well now you see me.

599
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,999
Yes, I saw it now.

600
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm disappointed.

601
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,167
The answer is no.

602
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,730
-Lord Glover, if you hear us.

603
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:33,250
they will come after you.

604
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:34,792
We take back this castle

605
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,167
of the iron men.

606
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,000
since it's my last night

607
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,042
- Now you want
and your stupidity.

608
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,334
Could be skinned

609
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,584
just to talk.

610
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,501
It's our war.
-Roose Bolton...

611
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,022
Other northern houses

612
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:47,501
Will they fight for you?

613
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:49,834
House Mormont.

614
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,417
When the black fish appears

615
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,334
- We sent ravens
- for Casas Manderly...

616
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,999
I don't care about crows.

617
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,646
He was a soldier before.

618
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:00,998
let me join your army.

619
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,167
from Above, the future House Tyrell.

620
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,334
in this army?

621
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:10,750
Most of the strength

622
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,999
is made up of Savages.

623
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,271
So the rumors

624
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,292
-He can start again.

625
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,250
I didn't dare believe them.

626
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,563
I received it here

627
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:26,876
respect for his father.

628
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:29,667
- Now I would like
- go away.

629
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,293
Casa Glover will not abandon

630
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,834
your ancestral home...

631
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:35,167
You have one hand.

632
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:38,543
-Mister Glover!

633
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:39,751
-There is nothing more to say.

634
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,480
I would like to remind you that the Glover House

635
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,167
House Stark is compromised.

636
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,271
He swore to answer

637
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,417
when called.

638
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:58,626
when the time came,

639
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,501
House Stark for centuries.

640
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:02,417
We cried when we found out

641
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:03,834
of his father's death.

642
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,521
When my brother

643
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:06,792
He was the lord of this castle...

644
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,605
he fulfilled Robb's request

645
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,375
and acclaimed him King of the North.

646
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,584
And where was King Robb...

647
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,771
when the men of iron

648
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,167
Did they attack this castle?

649
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,834
When they put my

650
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,459
wife and children in prison...

651
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,355
and brutalized and killed

652
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,792
our subordinates?

653
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:30,855
Joining a slut

654
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,125
foreigner.

655
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,438
killing yourself

656
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,167
and those who followed him.

657
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:43,668
I served House Stark once,

658
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,709
but House Stark is dead.

659
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,501
Why did we have to come here?

660
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,083
Some of us still like it.

661
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,334
At least drink something.

662
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,375
I do not want anything.

663
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,209
Don't go far, love.

664
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,542
I'll find her now.

665
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,438
Nothing in the Iron Islands

666
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,792
such a donkey.

667
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,542
Are you no longer interested?

668
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,209
- I'm not going to make jokes

669
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,834
- I'm not going to make jokes
- about this.

670
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,042
I will never hurt you, little brother.

671
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:26,584
Don't you know that?

672
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,792
- Do you think Uncle Euron
- are you behind us?

673
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:33,999
Course is.

674
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,876
I am your killer.

675
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:37,999
Company.

676
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:39,355
It's a big world

677
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:40,667
I did what I had to do

678
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:41,999
Drink it.

679
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:43,667
even to the gods.

680
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,834
- I don't care what you want.
If you say.

681
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:49,999
Gentlemen, please.

682
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,000
We have Lord Edmure.

683
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,626
and we betray our own.
Ramsay Bolton cannot

684
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,626
Bad years?

685
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,251
while your mother screamed

686
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,834
cower like a dog.

687
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:03,000
Drink the damn beer.

688
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,000
Now listen to me.

689
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
difficult to navigate.

690
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:13,209
The real Theon Greyjoy,

691
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,834
This is not false.

692
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,959
Can you find it for me?

693
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,501
Drink it.

694
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:23,375
You escaped. Hearing this?

695
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,667
You ran away and will never return.

696
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,834
We will bring you justice.

697
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:29,355
If justice existed, it would be

698
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,834
hanging in Winterfell.

699
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,022
of Seaworth House.

700
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,167
We will take revenge. Drink it.

701
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I put it in the cart, but it didn't happen.

702
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:41,563
If you're so devastated

703
00:36:41,564 --> 00:36:42,834
There is no return...

704
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,605
take a knife

705
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:45,626
and slit your wrists.

706
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:47,792
End it.

707
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,876
and start helping people.

708
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,292
Theon, I need you.

709
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:54,999
too much to go back.

710
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:57,063
We will make a pact with

711
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,375
this Queen of Dragons.

712
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:00,563
And we will resume

713
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:01,667
the Iron Islands.

714
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:05,792
You are with me?

715
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:08,999
Are you really with me?

716
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:28,834
Now...

717
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,396
since it's my last night

718
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:31,792
on dry land...

719
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,375
I'm going to have sex with that one.

720
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,771
Stannis camped here

721
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:48,000
It's not just any war.

722
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,000
It's our war.

723
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,001
He was the commander

724
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,375
most experienced in Westeros.

725
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:55,854
Chose this place

726
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:56,999
his successor because he knew...

727
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,563
The mountains are

728
00:37:58,564 --> 00:37:59,751
a natural fortification.

729
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,792
There's a stream there

730
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:01,793
for the horses.

731
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,709
- We're not staying here
- for a long time.

732
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,667
- There will be a storm
- any time.

733
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,854
Yes, the snows defeated

734
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,998
Stannis as much as the Boltons.

735
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,771
I will never forget.

736
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:13,542
now, while we can.

737
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,542
2.000 Selvagens...

738
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,998
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

739
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,626
62 Mormonts.

740
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,375
Why didn't they punish me?

741
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,959
Majesty.

742
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,521
some quarrelsome houses.

743
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:29,667
and be smart.

744
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:32,334
We will be the last

745
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,499
If you're as smart as you say you are,

746
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,999
trusted advisor now?

747
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,709
Porque ele garantiu 62 homens

748
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,417
de uma criança de 10 anos?

749
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,751
He's the reason why

750
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:45,042
I'm here talking to you...

751
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,834
and served Stannis for years.

752
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:48,918
Stannis who lost

753
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:49,959
Dark water...

754
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,499
who murdered his own

755
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,999
Brother, who doesn't have a head?

756
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:55,043
It is not enough.

757
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:56,459
We need more men.

758
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There is no time.

759
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:00,500
If we went to the Castle

760
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:01,998
Let's pray?

761
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:02,999
We fight with the army

762
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that we have.

763
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:08,229
Guys, it's not worth it

764
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,459
but we are proud.

765
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:13,999
We don't need to fight...

766
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,751
- -Who are you?
- -Hang on.

767
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,959
Yes, who are you?

768
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,000
He was a soldier before.

769
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,147
All my superiors

770
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:08,626
They thought I was brave.

771
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:09,998
Was not.

772
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,999
To mean,

773
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,999
I never ran away from a fight.

774
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,771
Just because I was scared that my

775
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:15,542
friends would see that he was scared.

776
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:17,000
He was just that, a coward...

777
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,876
who followed orders.

778
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,125
Lost.

779
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,000
Burn that village.

780
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:24,626
He is fine.

781
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:25,999
I'm your arsonist.

782
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,980
Steal the crops

783
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:29,542
of the farmer. I'm his thief.

784
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,084
Kill these young people

785
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,584
Or will he kill Edmure?

786
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:35,834
I am your killer.

787
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,604
Company.

788
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,125
shouting at us, saying...

789
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,209
So I was a drug dealer.

790
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,000
Drink it.

791
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,083
- If you can cross

792
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,396
Gentlemen, please.

793
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:49,792
Congress requires no desire

794
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:51,667
You too, come on.

795
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,230
- some bad years.

796
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,542
that boy...

797
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,876
while your mother screamed

798
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,918
and my friends held her.

799
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:05,999
That night...

800
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,000
You think I won't do it,

801
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:13,499
The shame was so heavy

802
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,999
that I couldn't eat...

803
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,626
I could not sleep.

804
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:19,396
All I could do was look

805
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:20,998
to that dark sky...

806
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:22,438
and hear that mother screaming

807
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,876
your child's name.

808
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:31,043
I will hear her screaming

809
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:32,459
before marching

810
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:37,668
I can't bring

811
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:38,751
that boy back.

812
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:39,938
All I can do

813
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:41,083
with the time left...

814
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,709
is to bring kindness to this world.

815
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,542
- That's all we can
- it does, doesn't it?

816
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,084
Nothing in the Iron Islands

817
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:48,334
stop stealing...

818
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,375
stop killing people...

819
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,209
and start helping people.

820
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's never late

821
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:55,001
too much to go back.

822
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:11,729
There is nothing to do

823
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,459
with answers to your prayers.

824
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,459
the Iron Islands.
- to do with the gods.

825
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,584
After they're done with me,

826
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,189
Learning that they have to respond

827
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,876
your own prayers.

828
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,083
and your stupidity.

829
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,709
How can we help?

830
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,792
It is not enough.

831
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,999
We are talking about life.

832
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You?

833
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:39,959
Protecting the people.

834
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,292
I'm disappointed.

835
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,876
- They are protecting us
Do what he says.

836
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:49,999
by the Free People...

837
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:51,959
We don't have horses.

838
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,083
It's your brother?

839
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,751
We don't have steel.

840
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:56,209
those walls...

841
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,834
Protecting people makes people hungry.

842
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,999
you will see an army at the gates,

843
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:01,999
You can stay

844
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,999
for dinner...

845
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,918
but we have hungry mouths here.

846
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:13,709
Protect yourselves.

847
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,084
Are you sure they will come?

848
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:17,125
and full of horrors.

849
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:42,999
"May the Seven save you, friends."

850
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,646
I'm a damn cult.

851
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:46,998
What should I say?

852
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,438
They don't believe in their

853
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,876
Seven. They are from the Brotherhood.

854
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,480
-They follow the Red God.

855
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:53,042
-Yes, everyone is welcome here.

856
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,083
We have nothing for them.

857
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,146
Clear. They have food, steel,

858
00:43:57,147 --> 00:43:59,167
even if they say no.

859
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,000
And you have women.

860
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,083
What do you want to do?

861
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:03,501
Fight them?

862
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:04,999
Kill them?

863
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,188
I didn't dare believe them.

864
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,000
Find comfort

865
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:10,918
Yes, you.

866
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:12,999
I don't want to fight anymore.

867
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,042
My mother was not beautiful nor did she have

868
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,542
Violence is a disease.

869
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:20,022
You can't cure a disease

870
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:21,501
spreading to more people.

871
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:23,999
Can't be cured by dying

872
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
hers too.

873
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,813
You've worked enough

874
00:44:28,814 --> 00:44:30,417
for today. Come have dinner.

875
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,375
It will be cold tonight.

876
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,542
This is my house.

877
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,459
I'll keep a bowl

878
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,751
of stew for you.

879
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:39,959
I think I have beer

880
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,000
warrior and a man of honor.

881
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,542
He is not a liar.

882
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,999
Talk about the Iron Fleet in the Bay

883
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,999
of Slaves. And I believe him.

884
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,188
You don't know the things I've done.

885
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:57,292
those crazy people.

886
00:44:57,918 --> 00:44:59,000
You are a Westerosi.

887
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:00,999
Why do you care?

888
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,959
I want to go home.

889
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,083
You?

890
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,417
will escape from here too.

891
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,230
-Where did you steal this from?

892
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:16,459
-Why do you care?

893
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,542
We will leave in two days.

894
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,959
There will be a hammock on the deck.

895
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,459
I want a cabin.

896
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,709
And we will leave at dawn.

897
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Until then.

898
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:52,792
Good girl.
